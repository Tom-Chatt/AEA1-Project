# AEA1-Project
Forecasting exchange rates using an ARIMA model. 

I am currently undertaking an Masters degree in Economics: Data Science at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. One of the modules in this course is Applied Economic Analysis 1 (AEA1), where we have been tasked with creating a Python Assignment.

## The details of which can be found here:

The idea of the assignment is that you report your findings in a transparent way that can easily be verified/reproduced by others.

#### The following ingredients will be important when we evaluate your assignment:

* Start with a clear and transparent question.
* There are a lot of interesting economic questions for which you do not need programming to find the answer. However, as an important part of this course is programming in python, we want to see some programming. So choose a question where you can show off your programming -skills!
* Briefly motivate why this question is interesting.
* Explain the method that you use to answer the question.
* Give the answer that you find.
* Mention the main assumptions that you need to get this answer.
* When you use information, create a link to this information. The reader then only needs to click to find the relevant information.
* If you use data, present graphs of the data.
* Include the data in your github respository so that we can replicate your analysis
* If you use equations, use latex to make them easy to read.
* Explain your code, the reader must be able to easily follow what you are doing.
* Present a clear conclusion/answer to your question.
* Programming is great to do sensitivity analysis, just do the same you did before, but now with different parameter   values.
* Include some discussion of what you find and elements on which you need additional information.
